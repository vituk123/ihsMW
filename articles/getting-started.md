# Getting started with ihsMW

The `ihsMW` package provides programmatic access to the Malawi
Integrated Household Survey (IHS) microdata hosted natively by the World
Bank Microdata Library. By using `ihsMW`, you can reliably discover,
harmonise, and download complex survey metrics directly into R,
significantly accelerating academic analyses.

## 1. Installation

You can install the development version of `ihsMW` from GitHub using the
`pak` or `remotes` package:

``` r
# Install from GitHub
pak::pak("vituk123/ihsMW")
# or
remotes::install_github("vituk123/ihsMW")
```

*(Note: CRAN installation commands will be available once the package is
officially published).*

## 2. One-time setup

The World Bank Microdata Library limits access to registered
researchers. You must retrieve a free API Key to access survey records
securely.

Run the authentication wizard directly from R. It will dynamically guide
you toward generating an API key securely:

``` r
library(ihsMW)

# Open the interactive authentication wizard
ihs_auth()
```

This command will open the World Bank Microdata Library in your browser.
Register, navigate to your profile, generate a token, and copy the
string.

Then, register your key within the package seamlessly:

``` r
ihs_auth("your_alphanumeric_api_key_goes_here")
```

This procedure only needs to be completed once mapping your credentials
persistently to your `~/.Renviron` profile securely on your local
device.

## 3. Finding variables

The `ihsMW` package maintains an internal harmonisation crosswalk
mapping thousands of distinct metrics accurately tracking naming
disparities across distinct rounds (IHS2 to IHS5).

You can explicitly search this map utilizing descriptive keywords:

``` r
# Look up variables related to consumption
ihs_search("consumption")
```

Alternatively, restrict your query natively capturing data specifically
from an explicit survey round implicitly avoiding unnecessary scope
overlaps:

``` r
# Find age-related variables specifically monitored during IHS5
ihs_search("age", round = "IHS5")
```

Should you wish to review variables explicitly inside their raw survey
contexts, explore modules seamlessly natively leveraging the World Bank
infrastructure:

``` r
# Look at all modules administered in IHS5
ihs_modules("IHS5")
```

Use
[`ihs_label()`](https://username.github.io/ihsMW/reference/ihs_label.md)
natively referencing Stata attributes preserving explicit meaning behind
discrete identifiers exactly mirroring internal documentation structures
natively:

``` r
ihs_label("rexp_cat01")
```

## 4. Downloading data

Once your targeted harmonised variables are identified, use the
overarching [`IHS()`](https://username.github.io/ihsMW/reference/IHS.md)
extractor capturing raw microdata formatting seamlessly binding values
natively resolving dependencies securely across cache targets without
rigid management requirements.

Acquire standalone elements cleanly extracting structural
representations iteratively locally:

``` r
# Simple extraction targeted against IHS5
df_simple <- IHS("rexp_cat01", round = "IHS5")
```

The true power of `ihsMW` extends gracefully targeting multiple
variables pooled simultaneously across disjointed rounds without manual
file joining restrictions matching parameters reliably natively:

``` r
# Multi-round pooled extractions mapping harmonisations intelligently
df_multi <- IHS(c("rexp_cat01", "hh_a02"), round = c("IHS4", "IHS5"))
```

The pooled structure integrates an explicit `ihs_round` character string
isolating origins intelligently supporting explicit group derivations
cleanly binding `data.frame` layers exactly natively accurately.

**Caching Integration**: `ihsMW` downloads raw components saving
parameters directly onto persistent native disk locations ensuring data
remains cached persistently seamlessly avoiding redundant API hits
natively!

## 5. A complete worked example

The following blocks detail a standard end-to-end integration mapping
discovery against consumption distributions smoothly integrating
visualization bindings securely directly formatting outputs correctly.

``` r
library(ihsMW)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Find the consumption variable
ihs_search("per capita consumption")

# Download IHS5 consumption data
df <- IHS("rexp_cat01", round = "IHS5")

# Quick summary
df |> summarise(mean_cons = mean(rexp_cat01, na.rm = TRUE))

# Simple histogram
ggplot(df, aes(x = rexp_cat01)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of per capita consumption, Malawi IHS5")
```

## 6. Citation

When publishing research utilizing datasets harmonized or accessed via
`ihsMW`, you must rigorously cite the sampling procedures matching
precise documents natively guaranteeing attribution accurately tracking
standard rules.

Always cite both the NSO Malawi and the World Bank LSMS natively
recognizing precise structures smoothly linking contributions reliably!
