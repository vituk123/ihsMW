# Cross-round harmonisation in ihsMW

The Malawi Integrated Household Survey (IHS) is a cornerstone of
socio-economic research in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, conducting
longitudinal or cross-sectional analyses pooling multiple rounds
traditionally requires hundreds of hours resolving structural
disparities. The `ihsMW` package abstracts this friction, providing
native cross-round harmonisation directly within R.

## 1. Why harmonisation is needed

The IHS survey instruments undergo systematic redesigns between rounds.
As policy goals evolve and enumeration techniques improve, modules are
shuffled, variables are renamed, and categorical response codes are
completely restructured.

For instance, consider the fundamental **Consumption Aggregate**. In
IHS2, the primary real per capita consumption variable was tracked as
`rexp_cat011` natively within the aggregates file. In IHS4, it was
fundamentally shifted, and by IHS5, it merged definitions slightly
demanding rigorous analyst verification.

Similarly, **Food Security Indicators** like the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) were only rigorously standardized in later
rounds. The variable denoting whether a household worried about not
having enough food was labeled differently, and placed inside
fundamentally different module prefixes across IHS3 and IHS5.

## 2. How ihsMW handles harmonisation

To resolve these inconsistencies, the `ihsMW` package bundles a static,
manually curated crosswalk table. This crosswalk securely maps a single
`harmonised_name` against the exact structural properties originally
defined inside each survey round.

The `harmonised_name` represents the consistent variable identifier you
use when querying `ihsMW`. Internally, the package translates this name
into the round-specific identifiers natively intercepting HTTP downloads
masking the complexity.

You can inspect the underlying crosswalk schema natively:

``` r
library(ihsMW)

# Load the raw crosswalk embedded inside the package
cw <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "ihs_crosswalk.csv", package = "ihsMW"))
head(cw)
```

## 3. Checking coverage before analysis

Before executing an analysis, it is critical to determine if your
desired indicators were actually collected across your target rounds.

The package exposes a macro-level validation tracker summarizing the
crosswalk’s health efficiently:

``` r
# Prints a report showing variable availability across rounds
ihs_crosswalk_check()
```

To zero in on specific indicators,
[`ihs_search()`](https://username.github.io/ihsMW/reference/ihs_search.md)
exposes exactly which rounds recorded the variable. You can manipulate
the underlying `tibble` directly to review coverage:

``` r
library(dplyr)

# Search for consumption and inspect coverage arrays
ihs_search("consumption") |> 
  select(harmonised_name, ihs2_name, ihs3_name, ihs4_name, ihs5_name)
```

## 4. Needs_review variables

Some variables undergo semantic drift across rounds despite capturing
fundamentally similar concepts. Our crosswalk flags these with a
`needs_review = TRUE` boolean internally.

When you query an indicator carrying this flag, `ihsMW` will emit a
non-blocking
[`cli::cli_warn()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_abort.html)
advising manual intervention. This flag signifies that while the
variable structurally aligns, the underlying response options, specific
definitions, or unit structures were fundamentally altered by the
enumeration designers.

When writing academic papers, if you utilize a flagged variable pooled
across rounds, you should rigorously consult the Basic Information
Document (BID) and explicitly outline your methodological assumptions
normalizing the semantic differences in your data appendix.

## 5. Multi-round worked example

The harmonisation pipeline intercepts requests natively yielding pooled
arrays iteratively appending tracking boundaries effortlessly.

``` r
# Extract consumption metrics mapped identically across IHS3, IHS4, and IHS5
df <- IHS("rexp_cat01", round = c("IHS3", "IHS4", "IHS5"))

# The output natively includes an `ihs_round` character tracking origins
df |>
  group_by(ihs_round) |>
  summarise(mean_cons = mean(rexp_cat01, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## 6. When NOT to use auto-harmonisation

While `ihsMW` binds datasets effectively, auto-harmonisation is
dangerous when explicit conceptual alignment is required but compromised
inherently:

1.  **Variables with fundamentally different concepts.** If a module
    measured discrete 7-day recall in IHS3, but continuously tracked
    14-day recall in IHS4 without conversion mappings mathematically
    recorded.
2.  **Value label changes.** Region codes may have been completely
    renumbered (e.g., District 104 becoming District 201) breaking
    factor mappings silently during numerical bindings.

**Recommendation:** The harmonisation wrapper is not a substitute for
due diligence. Always meticulously review the respective Basic
Information Documents (BIDs) available on the World Bank Microdata
Library ensuring your conceptual endpoints align securely.

## 7. Contributing to the crosswalk

The internal crosswalk is a living document rigorously curated by the
community. You can suggest modifications, correct mapping errors, or map
previously unlinked variables across surveys by contributing directly.

alignments to our [GitHub issues
